This part of the [TMWA book](/en/apv/) guides you through actual development of web application.
However this is no ordinary tutorial. Here I show you all the necessary steps, I also try to show
you how to approach different problems. There are examples and there are exercises with hidden
solutions. I very much encourage you to look at them only when you completed the exercise 
(or when you are terribly stuck). And finally, **it is open ended**. There is no final solution which 
you can copy and paste and pretend you've written it all. Sorry about that :) However the
walkthrough contains everything you need to know and use to build the final solution (whatever that would be).

The walkthrough revolves around a web application for managing contacts and meetings. As there are
thousands of solutions to this, I have prepared a 
[database schema](/en/apv/walkthrough/database/#database-schema) which I will use 
through the examples and exercises (nothing prevents you from changing it). 

## Requirements
You should be capable of slightly advanced use of your computer -- you should know how to
install programs, use [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
etc. To get you started with basic source code writing skills, I suggest you take 
some [courses at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
