## Engineering
- Basic principles of Engineering:
  - **Reproducibility** (do the same thing more than once),
  - Measurability (define what is *same*),
  - Portability (as a result of the above),
  - Standardization (formal or industrial),
  - Documentation (what else is needed for reproducibility),
  - Organization (no randomness).
- Apply these principles in Software Engineering.

## Computer networks
- Systems for transmitting data between computers
- Layered architecture (different approaches):
  - Physical level -- hardware, wires, wireless
  - Logical level:
    - Network organization and topology
    - Addressing and communication protocols
  - Application level:
    - Services and applications offered to end-users
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Client-Server
- Client-Server is a **relation** between two subjects.
- Server is passive (serves), fulfills client **requests**.
- The relation can be observed on many levels:
  - Relation between entire Systems,
  - Relation between application parts, computer processes.
- Examples:
  - Web Browser is a client to a Web Server,
  - Web Server is a client to a Database Server,
  - Web Browser is a server to an end user,
  - Computer is a server to an end user.
- Opposite: P2P architecture.

## Computer networks
- Need a communication protocol (set of rules).
- In applications we are not interested in the physical layer.
- A computer network from an application viewpoint:

## Internet protocols
- Most networks use protocols from the TCP/IP protocol suite.
- Internet is every network using the TCP/IP protocol suite.
  - **The Internet** vs. **internet** vs. **intranet**
- IP (Internet Protocol) -- A basic transmission protocol (packets).
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) -- A reliable protocol.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) -- An unreliable protocol.
- Dozens of protocols for network services (DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SMTP, SSH, â€¦).
- Internet standards are marked as RFC (industry standards).
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Addresses
- Hardware address (MAC address) -- unusable in the application layer:
  - Assigned by the device manufacturer,
  - **Reasonably** worldwide unique.
- Logical address (IP Address) -- most important for transmission:
  - Assigned by the network administrator,
  - Respects topology of the network and can be used to find the physical device location.
- Name address (Domain Name) -- used by end-users only:
  - Assigned through DNS (service/server/system),
  - Must be translated (M:N) to an IP Address for transmission.
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Addressing hosts
- For communication between two hosts, the logical addresses of both devices must be known.
- Domain names must be translated to logical addresses.
- One host may run multiple applications, a **socket** must be used to distinguish between them.
- For communication between applications, both the source and destination socket must be known.
- Socket = IP Address + Port.
- Port is a numeric identifier of the application (1-65535).
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Network Services
- Network Services are various applications offered to the end-users of the internet network
- Each service has a network protocol (and therefore the port) assigned to it:
  - Destination ports are **well-known**,
  - Source ports are **ephemeral**.
</section>

## Connection example
- HTTP protocol uses port 80:
  - `apache.exe TCP server:80 server:0 LISTENING`
  - `opera.exe TCP pc19:4307 server:80 ESTABLISHED`
  - `apache.exe TCP server:80 pc19:4307 ESTABLISHED`
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Address Format
- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used by many services.
- `protocol://user:password@address:port/path?query`
  - `protocol` -- a registered protocol name (required),
  - `user` and `password` -- optional credentials (discouraged),
  - `address` -- either an IP address or a name address of the destination host (required),
  - `port` -- a socket port (required),
  - `path` -- a directory to the actual requested file,
  - `query` -- `name-value` pairs optionally supplied to the requested file.
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## WWW Service
- WWW (World Wide Web) Service is a system for providing linked text documents.
- The service offers access to published documents -- **web pages**.
- Web pages can be:
  - static -- must be manually changed on the server,
  - dynamic -- generated by an application on the web server.
- WWW service uses the **HTTP** (Hyper-text transfer) protocol for transmitting the
web pages.
- Web pages are usually created using the HTML language.
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## HTTP Protocol
- HTTP is a **stateless** protocol:
  - Communication is split into transactions,
  - Each transaction creates a new HTTP connection,
  - Together with terminating the transaction, all state information is lost:
    - Theoretically this prevents someone from logging in, but there is a way around this.
    - Requests from a single client are isolated on the server and they are difficult to be connected together.
- HTTP is a **text** protocol.
</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## HTTP Transaction
- An HTTP Transaction is composed of the steps:
  - Establish a connection (client),
  - Send a request (client),
  - Send a response (server),
  - Terminate the connection (server).
- Both the request and the response consist of **headers** and **body**.
  - An HTTP Transaction fulfills a single HTTP request.
- Many HTTP transactions are required to load a single page.

## Checkpoint
- What is the difference between the web and the internet?
- How many different TCP/IP protocols do you use in a day?
- How many HTTP request have you sent during reading these slides?
- What use is an unreliable protocol?
- Is it more important to know the protocol or the port?
- Is it possible to download a page without creating a socket?
- Can you visit a page by knowing just the MAC address of the server?
- Can a server be a client?
