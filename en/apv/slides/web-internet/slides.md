## Engineering
- Basic principles of Engineering
 - Reproducibility (do the same thing more than once)
 - Measurability (define what is *same*)
 - Portability (as a reasult of the above)
 - Standardization (formal or industrial) 
 - Documentation (what else is need for reproducibility)
 - Organization (no randomness)
- Apply those principles in Software Engineering

</section>

## Computer networks
- Systems for transmitting data between computers
- Layered architercture (different approaches):
 - Physical level -- hardware, wires, wireless
 - Logical level 
  - Network organization and topology
  - Addressing and communcation protocols
 - Application level
  - Services and applications offfered to end-users

</section>

## Client-Server
- Client-Server is a **relation** between two subjects
- Server is passive (serves), does only what is requested from a client
- The relation can be observered on many levels:
 - Relation between entire Systems
 - Relation between application parts, computer processes
- Examples:
 - Web Browser is client to Web Server
 - Web Server is client to Datbase Server
 - Web Browser is server to end user
 - Computer is server to end user
- Opposite: P2P architercture

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Computer networks
- Need a communcation protocol (set of rules)
- In applications we are not interested in physical layer
- This is a computer network from Application viewpoint

## Internets protocols
- Most networks today use protocols from TCP/IP protocol suite
- Internet is every network build on TCP/IP protocol suite
 - **The Internet** vs. **internet** vs. **intranet**
- IP (Internet Protocol) -- Basic transmission protocol, others are build on it 
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) -- Reliable protocol for data transmission
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) -- Unereliable protocol for data transmission
- dozens of other protocols for network servies
- Internet standards are marked as RFC (industrial standards)

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Addresses
- Hardware address (MAC address) -- unusuable in appliction layer
 - assigned by device manufacturer
 - *reasonably worldwide unique* 
- Logical address (IP Address) -- most important for transmission
 - assigned by network administrator
 - respects topology of network and can be used to find physical location of device
- Name address (Domain Name) -- used by end-users only 
 - assigned through DNS service/server/system
 - must be translated to IP Address for transmission
 - M:N translation

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Addressing hosts
- For communcation between two hosts, the logical addresses of both devices must be known
- Domain names must be trnaslated to logical addresses
- One host may run multiple applications, to distinguish between them a **socket** must be used
- For communcation between applications, both source and destination **socket** must be known
- Socket = IP Address + Port
- Port is numeric identifier of the application (1-65535)

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Network Services
- Network Services are various applications offered to the end-users of the Internet network
- Each service has a network protocol (and therefore port) assigned to it
- Desination ports are **well-known**, source ports are ephemeral
- Example â€“ HTTP protocol uses port 80:
 - apache.exe TCP server:80 server:0 LISTENING
 - opera.exe TCP pc19:4307 server:80 ESTABLISHED
 - apache.exe TCP server:80 pc19:4307 ESTABLISHED

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## Internet Address Format
- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used by many internet services
 - `protocol://user:password@address:port/path?query`
  - `protocol` part is registered protocol name 
  - `user` and `password` are optional credentials (not used much)
  - `address` is either and IP address or name address of the destination host
  - `port` is socket port
  - `path` is directory to the actual requested file
  - `query` is `name-value` pairs optionally supplied to the requested file.
 - required URL parts are `protocol`, `addres` and `port` 

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## WWW Service
- WWW (World Wide Web) Service is a system for providing linked text documents
- The service offers access to published documents -- web pages
- Web pages can be
 - static -- must be changed on the server
 - dynamic -- generated by an application on the web server
- WWW service uses HTTP (Hyper-text transfer) protocol for transmitting the 
web pages
- Web pages are usually created using the HTML language.

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## HTTP Protocol
- HTTP is **stateless** protocol
 - Communication is split into transactions
 - Each transaction creates a new HTTP connection
 - Togher with terminating the transaction, all state information is lost
  - Theoretically this prevents someone from logging in, but 
  there is a way around this
 - Requests from a single client are isolated on the server and they
 are difficult to connect together
- HTTP is **text** protocol

</section>

<section markdown='1'>
## HTTP Transaction
- HTTP Transaction consists of:
 - estabilish connection (client)
 - send request (client)
 - send response (server)
 - teminate connection (server)
- Both request and respons consist of **headers** and **body**  
 - HTTP Transaction fullfills a single HTTP request 
- Many HTTP transactions are required to load a single page

## Checkpoint
- What is the difference between web and internet?
- How many diffferent TCP/IP protocols you use in a day?
- How many HTTP request have you send during reading these slides?
- What use is unreliable protocol?
- Is it more important to know protocol or port?
- Is it possible to download a page without creating a socket?
- Can you visit a page by knowing just MAC address of the server?
- Can a server be a client?
