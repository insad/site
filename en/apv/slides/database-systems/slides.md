- goal is to obtain information from data
- the majority of BDP applications are **Information Systems**
 - Company **Information Systems**
  - contains a collection of many different agendas (SIS)
  - e.g. finance, inventory, facility
  - it is not just the software

## Separate Information Systems
- the company information system is composed of unlreated sub-systems (SIS)
 - each system has its own application code
 - each system has its own data store
- format and structure of data are tied to each sub-system requirements
 - therefore they are **incompatible**
 - where there is incomatibility, there is **isolation**
 - where there is isolation, there is **redunancy**
 - where there is redundancy, there is **inconsitency**
- no one wants inconsitency
