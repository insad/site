In this part of the book I will show you a way how to save some work and use freely available predefined CSS styles
instead of making your own (which are usually not very nice looking).

## Bootstrap
I recommend to use CSS framework called Bootstrap. It can deliver nice modern look for your application
without having to worry about writing too many CSS code. You just go online and select appropriate widget
from their online library [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Linking Bootstrap to your app simple: go to their download page and copy those few lines from "Bootstrap CDN" section. 

### Tables, forms, inputs, navigation...

## Task -- Use Bootstrap
Try to apply Bootstrap CSS classes on your application's HTML code and make it look modern.

### Responsive design with Bootstrap

#### Media querries

## CSS Positioning
CSS can be used to completely modify page layout. You can set `fixed`, `absolute` or `relative` positioning
of elements.

## CSS Preprocessors
If you feel that CSS with its flat structure and lack of variables can get out of hands after some time,
you are not alone! For this purpose a CSS preprocessors were invented -- most popular preprocessors today are
[LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). This is too advanced to start with, just
try to remember this information until you start to write your first big project.
