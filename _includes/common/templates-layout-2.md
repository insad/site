## Summary
In this chapter, you have learned how to use *layout templates*. Layout templates provide a way to
a better organized shared HTML code between various pages of your web application. By reducing
repetition, they save you time, reduce number of errors and lead to a consistent page look & feel.

On the other hand, you have probably noticed that now your application contains much more files
(and it may be difficult to be oriented in them) and that the pages are not any more self-contained
-- i.e. they become only snippets of the HTML code. This requires a bit of training and getting used to,
because now the application code is slightly more abstract than it was at the beginning.

For small application the overhead of repeated code might be smaller than the overhead of well
structured code. As your application grows the overhead of repeated code would increase but
the overhead of structured code remains constant.

Now you should be familiar with the reasons for using layout templates. You should be able to
create and use a simple page layout with multiple blocks. You should be familiar with the
concept of inheritance.
