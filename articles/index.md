This part of the [TMWA book](/en/apv/) concentrates on explaining the principles 
of the technologies used. This part is parallel to the [walkthrough](/en/apv/walkthrough/), which
guides you through creating your own application. Generally, the articles here can be read in
any order, although if you are new to programming, you should probably start from the 
[beginning](/en/apv/articles/programming/).

This part is accompanied with [presentation slides](/en/apv/slides/) used
during our lectures. If you want to get a quick overview, you can start with these slides, because
they link to the longer articles where applicable.
